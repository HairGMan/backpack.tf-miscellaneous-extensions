# backpack.tf - Miscellaneous Extensions
_____________________________________________
This is an userscript to add miscellaneous functionality to backpack.tf (which I would have liked for myself).
Currently included is:
* In inventories add a Sort by paint


## Installation
_____________________________________________
Use an extension which can execute userscripts (F.e. [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) for [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)  for [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox))
and then install using this link: [backpack.tf extended sorting.user.js](https://github.com/NetroScript/backpack.tf-miscellaneous-extensions/raw/master/backpack.tf%20extended%20sorting.user.js).

(Or paste / install it manually for your plugin)
